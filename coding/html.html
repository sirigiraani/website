      <h2>Our Coding Programs and Learning Approach</h2>
      <p>At E-Learning Academy, all courses are conducted offline at our learning center for an engaging, hands-on experience. Below is a list of our coding programs and their teaching approaches:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>HTML Basics</strong>
          <p><strong>Approach</strong>: In-person classes with instructor-led coding demos on lab computers. Students learn HTML fundamentals through practical assignments and group discussions, focusing on tags, document structure, and forms. Progress is tracked via quizzes and a final project to build a simple webpage.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>CSS Fundamentals</strong>
          <p><strong>Approach</strong>: Offline sessions emphasize styling techniques with live demonstrations. Students practice on provided computers, creating styled web pages. Group critiques and bi-weekly assessments ensure mastery of layouts, colors, and responsive design principles.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>JavaScript Essentials</strong>
          <p><strong>Approach</strong>: In-person interactive coding sessions where students build dynamic web features. Weekly coding challenges and pair-programming exercises reinforce variables, functions, and DOM manipulation. Progress is tracked through quizzes and projects.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Python Programming</strong>
          <p><strong>Approach</strong>: Offline classes with hands-on coding labs teach Python fundamentals. Students work on exercises covering loops, functions, and data structures using lab computers. Weekly assignments and a final project assess progress.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>C++ Programming</strong>
          <p><strong>Approach</strong>: In-person classes focus on C++ fundamentals, including variables, loops, and object-oriented programming. Students practice on lab computers with guided coding exercises. Weekly assignments and a final project, such as a simple console application, track mastery.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Java Programming</strong>
          <p><strong>Approach</strong>: Offline sessions teach Java fundamentals through hands-on labs. Students work on lab computers, covering classes, methods, and exception handling. Regular coding exercises, group discussions, and a final project ensure practical understanding.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>SQL Fundamentals</strong>
          <p><strong>Approach</strong>: In-person classes introduce database concepts using SQL. Students practice queries on lab computers, focusing on creating, updating, and querying databases. Weekly exercises and a final project designing a database schema reinforce skills.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Web Development Bootcamp</strong>
          <p><strong>Approach</strong>: Comprehensive offline program integrating HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and basic backend concepts. Students work on real-world projects in a classroom setting, with instructor guidance, regular code reviews, team projects, and a capstone portfolio project.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
